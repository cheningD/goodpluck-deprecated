        If there is a problem with your order, or you simply wish to give feedback, email us at help@goodpluck.com. We
        love hearing from you, the good and the bad. And if it's bad news we will do everything we can to make it right!
      </p>
      <h2>Returns</h2>
      <p>
        Goodpluck does not accept returns or exchanges of any products once they have shipped. This helps us get you the
        freshest foods possible
      </p>
      <h2>Refunds and Credits</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any issue with your order, please let us know by emailing help@goodpluck.com. Do this within 7 days
        of your delivery date, as we cannot offer refunds or credits after this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have missing products or an issue with your order we may, at our sole discretion, give you credit for the
        product and, in some situations, offer a full or partial refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to require a photograph for product quality complaints before any credit or refund is
        issued.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you receive a credit, you will receive a confirmation email from Goodpluck. The account credit will be
        applied to your account within 7 days of receipt of the confirmation email.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you receive a refund, it will take up to 10 days for the refund to be processed depending on your bank or
        credit card company. If you don't see the refund in that time frame please contact your bank or credit card
        company directly regarding their refund policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need an updated receipt or any other help with returns, refunds or credits, please email
        help@goodpluck.com. Thanks!
